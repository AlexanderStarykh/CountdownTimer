## Countdown timer on JS native
_______________________________
## *How to use:*
1. In the end of script you need to add in `setClock('timer', deadLine);` you need to pass id of element with timer instead of `timer` and your variable with your deadline instead of `deadLine`
2. In this part of the code, replace the search keys with your own.
```
            hours = timer.querySelector('.hours'),
            minutes = timer.querySelector('.minutes'),
            seconds = timer.querySelector('.seconds'),
            days = timer.querySelector('.days'),
```
#### P.S You can add or remove "day/week/month/year" by adding new variebles like "hours/minutes/seconds".
